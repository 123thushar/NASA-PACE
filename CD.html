   <h3> Cloud data</h3>
    The satellite’s Ocean Color Instrument, which was built and
    managed by NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt,
    Maryland, observes the ocean, land, and atmosphere across a
    spectrum of ultraviolet, visible, and near infrared light. While
    previous ocean color satellites could only detect a handful of
    wavelengths, PACE is detecting more than 200 wavelengths. With
    this extensive spectral range, scientists can identify specific
    communities of phytoplankton. Different species play different
    roles in the ecosystem and carbon cycle — most are benign, but
    some are harmful to human health — so distinguishing
    phytoplankton communities is a key mission of the satellite.<br>
    PACE’s two multi-angle polarimeters, HARP2 and SPEXone,
    measure polarized light that has reflected off clouds and tiny
    particles in the atmosphere. These particles, known as aerosols, can
    range from dust to smoke to sea spray and more. The two
    polarimeters are complementary in their capabilities. SPEXone,
    built at the Netherlands Institute for Space Research (SRON) and
    Airbus Netherlands B.V., will view Earth in hyperspectral
    resolution – detecting all the colors of the rainbow – at five
    different viewing angles. HARP2, built at the University of
    Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC), will observe four
    wavelengths of light, with 60 different viewing angles.<br>
    Early data from the SPEXone polarimeter instrument aboard PACE
    show aerosols in a diagonal swath over Japan on Mar. 16, 2024, and
    Ethiopia on Mar. 6, 2024. In the top two panels, lighter colors
    represent a higher fraction of polarized light. In the bottom panels,
    SPEXone data has been used to differentiate between fine aerosols,
    like smoke, and coarse aerosols, like dust and sea spray. SPEXone
    data can also measure how much aerosols are absorbing light from
    the Sun. Above Ethiopia, the data show mostly fine particles
    absorbing sunlight, which is typical for smoke from biomass
    burning. In Japan, there are also fine aerosols, but without the
    same absorption. This indicates urban pollution from Tokyo, blown
    toward the ocean and mixed with sea salt. The SPEXone
    polarization observations are displayed on a background true color
    image from another of PACE’s instruments, OCI.<br>

    With these data, scientists will be able to measure cloud properties
    — which are important for understanding climate — and monitor,
    analyze, and identify atmospheric aerosols to better inform the
    public about air quality. Scientists will also be able to learn how
    aerosols interact with clouds and influence cloud formation, which
    is essential to creating accurate climate models.

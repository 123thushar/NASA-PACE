    <h3>PACE MISSION</h3>
PACE will extend and improve NASAâ€™s 20 plus
years of global satellite observations of our
living ocean, atmospheric aerosols, and clouds
and initiate an advanced set of climate-relevant
data records. By determining the distribution
of phytoplankton, PACE will help assess ocean
health. It will also continue key measurements
related to air quality and climate.<br>
<h3>Science Goals</h3>
To extend systematic ocean color, atmospheric
aerosol, and cloud data records for Earth system
and climate studies.<br>
To address new and emerging science questions
by detecting a broader range of color wavelengths
that will provide new and unprecedented detail.<br>
<h3>Key Mission Characteristics</h3>
Hyperspectral ocean color instrument<br>
Two multi-angle polarimeters<br>
Launch readiness date: January 2024<br>
675 km (419 mi) orbital altitude<br>
Sun-synchronous, polar orbit<br>
Global coverage every two days<br>
Managed by Goddard Space Flight Center<br>
